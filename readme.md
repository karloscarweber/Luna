# Luna

A programming language written in Lua for fun. Compiles .luna files to Lua. Developed with LuaJIT in mind.

## Development.
To get started install luarocks. `brew install luarocks`. Also install luajit: `brew install luajit`. Install the test framework: `luarocks install busted`. That should be good.

## Running tests.
We use the `busted` testing framework for tests. Which is great. Everyone loves it. run: `busted`, to get the test suite testing.
